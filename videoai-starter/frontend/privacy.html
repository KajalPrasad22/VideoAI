      <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> September 12, 2025</p>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how VideoAI (“we,” “us,” or “our”) 
        collects, uses, stores, and discloses information, including personal data, 
        in connection with our services (“Services”) available at 
        <a href="https://yourdomain.com">https://yourdomain.com</a> (the “Website”). 
        We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your personal data 
        in a transparent and secure manner. Please read this Policy carefully. 
        For additional details, please review our Terms of Service.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p><strong>1.1. Google User Data.</strong> If you sign in using your Google account, we may collect basic profile information (email, name, and public profile picture) for authentication and account creation.</p>
      <p><strong>1.2. Other Personal Data.</strong> We do not collect personal data beyond your Google profile data, except for information you voluntarily provide (e.g., contacting support).</p>
      <p><strong>1.3. Cookies and Tracking.</strong> We use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication, which may create a cookie. We also use analytics services like Google Analytics (and similar tools) that employ cookies or similar tracking technologies to gather usage data for service improvement.</p>

      <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p><strong>2.1. Authentication and Communication.</strong> We use your Google user data (name and email) to authenticate your account, personalize your experience, and send product-related emails.</p>
      <p><strong>2.2. Analytics and Service Enhancement.</strong> We analyze usage data to troubleshoot technical issues, monitor performance, and improve our Services.</p>
      <p><strong>2.3. Future Integrations.</strong> We may request your explicit consent in the future to access your YouTube account (e.g., to read playlists or process videos). We will provide additional disclosures at that time.</p>

      <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
      <p><strong>3.1. Service Providers.</strong> We may rely on third-party providers (e.g., hosting, analytics, cloud services). These providers may access data when necessary to perform services on our behalf but are contractually obligated to maintain confidentiality.</p>
      <p><strong>3.2. Internal Access.</strong> Authorized personnel at VideoAI may access user data for legitimate business reasons and under confidentiality obligations.</p>
      <p><strong>3.3. Legal Requirements.</strong> We may disclose your data to comply with applicable law or legal processes, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of our users or the public.</p>
      <p><strong>3.4. No Sale of Data.</strong> We do not sell or rent your personal data under any circumstances.</p>

      <h2>4. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
      <p>We store your personal data as long as your account remains active or as necessary to provide Services. If you wish to deactivate or delete your data, please contact us at 
        <a href="mailto:support@videoai.com">support@videoai.com</a>. We will delete your data unless retention is required or permitted by law.</p>

      <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
      <p>We use commercially reasonable measures to protect your data. Despite our efforts, no security measure is infallible, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection against unauthorized access, hacking, or data breaches.</p>

      <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>The Services are not intended for individuals under 13. Children under 13 should not use our Services, and if we discover we have unintentionally collected such data, we will promptly delete it. Please notify us if you believe we have collected a child’s information.</p>

      <h2>7. International Data Transfers</h2>
      <p>Our primary servers may be located outside your country. If you access the Services from outside, you consent to your data being transferred and processed in those regions, where data protection laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction.</p>

      <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights under data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) to request access, correction, or deletion of your personal data. To exercise these rights, please email us at 
        <a href="mailto:support@videoai.com">support@videoai.com</a>. We will respond as required by applicable law.</p>
      <p>If you reside in specific regions (e.g., EEA, UK, certain U.S. states), you may also have the right to object to processing, request data portability, or lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.</p>

      <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Policy to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. If we make significant changes, we will notify you by posting a prominent notice on the Website or via email. Your continued use of the Services following the posting of the updated Policy constitutes acceptance of the changes.</p>

      <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
