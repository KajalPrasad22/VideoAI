      <p>Welcome to VideoAI!</p>

      <p>
        These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of VHS Media Group LTD ("the Company," "we," "us," or "our") note-taking and video summarisation product and services (the "Services") available at 
        <a href="https://videoai.com">https://videoai.com</a> (the "Website"). By using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use the Services.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Services</h2>
      <p>The Services provided by the Company include the ability to summarize the content of YouTube videos using the transcript provided with the videos, and offering the possibility to jump to the right location in the video. The Services are intended to be used for educational, research, and digital note-taking purposes. The Company does not repost YouTube videos and operates in compliance with YouTube Terms of Service and applicable copyright laws.</p>

      <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
      <p>The Services are intended for individuals who are at least 13 years of age. By accessing or using the Services, you represent and warrant that you meet this age requirement. If you do not meet this requirement, you must not access or use the Services.</p>

      <h2>3. Account Registration</h2>
      <p>To access certain features of the Services, you may be required to create an account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account information and password and for any activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify the Company immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or password, or any other breach of security. You may not use anyone else's account or password at any time.</p>

      <h2>4. Content and Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p><strong>4.1</strong> The content of the YouTube videos, including the video, audio, transcript, and any other material, remains the intellectual property of the original creators. The Company’s Services provide transcripts, derivative summaries, and annotations for easier consumption and discovery, intended to drive traffic to the original YouTube videos. We respect the ownership of all original content and do not claim any rights over it. All thumbnails are displayed via direct links to YouTube’s CDN and are neither stored nor modified by VideoAI.</p>
      <p><strong>4.2</strong> The summaries, annotations, and timestamps generated by the Services are the intellectual property of the Company. Users may use these summaries, annotations, and timestamps for personal, educational, or research purposes only, provided that they attribute the source to https://videoai.com and link back to the original YouTube video. Any other use, including but not limited to reproduction, distribution, or commercial use, requires the prior written consent of the Company.</p>

      <h2>5. Copyright and Fair Use</h2>
      <p>The Services operate within the bounds of copyright law and adhere to the principles of fair use. We do not claim ownership of any original content used in our summaries and rely on fair use for educational, research, and transformative purposes. However, fair use can be subjective and may vary depending on jurisdiction. If you believe your rights have been infringed, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@videoai.com">contact@videoai.com</a> for prompt resolution.</p>

      <h2>6. Content Submission</h2>
      <p>When submitting personal videos or audio files to the Service, you represent and warrant that you hold all necessary rights and permissions for such content. You are responsible for ensuring that your content does not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third parties. We reserve the right to remove any content that is found or claimed to be infringing without prior notice.</p>

      <h2>7. Content Accuracy and Representation Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>While we strive for accuracy in our summaries and annotations, we cannot guarantee that these will always perfectly reflect the original content. Summaries are intended as a brief overview and may not capture every aspect of the source material. They should not be considered exact representations of the original content.</p>

      <h2>8. Paid Subscriptions (Plus, Pro, Business)</h2>
      <p>The Services offer three paid subscription tiers — Plus, Pro, and Business — available on monthly or yearly plans. By subscribing, you agree to the features and limitations outlined on our pricing page. Subscriptions are binding agreements, and upon cancellation, users retain access to their allocated minutes/time until the end of the current billing cycle. No refunds will be provided for unused portions of the subscription.</p>

      <h2>9. Third-Party Dependence</h2>
      <p>The Services rely on third-party platforms such as YouTube. Changes in these platforms’ terms of service, policies, or functionality could impact the Service. We are not responsible for any disruption or loss of service resulting from such changes. We will attempt to adapt promptly, but under severe circumstances, part of the Service may be discontinued. In such cases, we will endeavor to provide an alternative solution or refund users for any unused subscription portion.</p>

      <h2>10. User Responsibility</h2>
